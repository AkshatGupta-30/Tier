### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v18+ recommended)
  * npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tier.git
    cd tier
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run in Development Mode:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    *Note: This will start the Vite server.*

### Loading the Extension in Chrome (Development)

1.  Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2.  Enable **"Developer mode"** in the top right corner.
3.  Click **"Load unpacked"**.
4.  Select the `dist` folder generated by the build (or the root folder if using the dev server with CRXJS).

## 📦 Building for Production

To create an optimized build for deployment or permanent installation:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder containing the compiled assets, `manifest.json`, and service workers ready for the Chrome Web Store or manual installation.

## 🧩 Key Architecture Concepts

### Bookmark Handling

Tier interfaces directly with the `chrome.bookmarks` API. To provide a reactive experience, a Redux slice (`src/store/slices/bookmark.ts`) mirrors the bookmark tree state, allowing the UI to update instantly while performing async Chrome API calls in the background.

### Theming Engine

The theme engine (`src/hooks/useTheme.ts`) persists user preferences to `localStorage`. It dynamically applies CSS classes to the `body` element and manages background image rendering, supporting both CSS gradients and base64 encoded custom images.

### Context Menu

A custom context menu implementation (`src/components/BookmarkMenu.tsx`) replaces the default browser context menu, providing specific actions based on whether the user right-clicked a bookmark, a folder, or empty space.
